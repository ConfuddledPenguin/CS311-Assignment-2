CS311 - Assignment 2
====================

This is the second assignment for the class CS311 - Programming Languages Definition & Implementation at the University of Strathclyde.

The aim of this assignment is to "test all your hard-won theoretical knowledge of programming language definition in the practical context of language implementation.

The aim is to produce a program that takes a file containing a TRIV program ( for an online example view here - http://triv-operational-demo.appspot.com/) and check its syntax and semantics, informing the user if it is a valid TRIV program and whats its denotational meaning is.

It is built off of 4 classes provided by the lecturer.
